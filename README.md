## ðŸ§  Thought Process & Design Decisions

This ToDoList app was designed with simplicity, performance, and usability in mind:

- **State Management:** I chose **GetX** for efficient state handling and routing, which ensures fast performance and clean separation of UI and logic.
- **Architecture:** The app follows the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** pattern to keep logic and UI separate for maintainability and scalability.
- **Data Persistence:** I used **Hive** to store tasks locally, even when the app is closed or restarted.
- **Notifications:** The app uses **flutter_local_notifications** to alert users about upcoming tasks.
- **UI/UX:** Built with **Material Design** principles for a clean and intuitive interface.
- **Features Covered:**
  - Add, Edit, Delete Tasks
  - Task Priority and Due Date
  - Search and Sort
  - Local Notifications
  - Offline Data Storage

This project showcases my understanding of Flutter, clean code practices, and building user-focused apps.
